// Description: Design a guessing game about you that involves FIVE yes/no questions. Be creative and fun and whimsical. Or not.

'use strict'; //enforces good practices

/*The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers,
and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses,
with either .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input
and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.*/

/* Useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS are well written
and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.*/

// Prompt user with y/n question and store response in variable
// Change user input to lower case and evaluate conditionally, then alert the user
var myName = prompt('What\'s my name?');
if (myName.toLowerCase() === 'inspector lee') {
  alert('Yes, but you can call me Lee.');
} else {
  alert('It\'s Inspector Lee damnit. Don Cheadle backed me up on that one time.');
}
// Print the stored variable to the console
console.log('First question answered with: ' + myName);

// Prompt user with y/n question and store response in variable
// Change user input to lower case and evaluate conditionally, then alert the user
var searchPerson = prompt('Who am I searching for?');

  alert('Yes, I only care about the girl!');
} else if (searchPerson.toLowerCase() === 'juntao') {

} else {

} else {

I\'m the King. I\'m Michael Jackson, you\'re Tito.');
}
// Print the stored variable to the console

// Prompt user with y/n question and store response in variable
// Change user input to lower case and evaluate conditionally, then alert the user
